# Prodigy-Internship
During my cybersecurity internship with Prodigy Infotech, I worked on a range of practical tasks to strengthen my skills in cybersecurity and Python scripting.
Some of the key tasks I completed include:

Developing a Simple Keylogger to capture keystrokes securely.

Building a Packet Sniffer to capture and analyze network packets.

Implementing a Caesar Cipher encryption tool for basic data security.

Creating a Password Complexity Checker to validate password strength.

Through these hands-on projects on Kali Linux, I gained experience in socket programming, network packet analysis, cryptography basics, secure coding practices, and input validation techniques.
This internship provided valuable real-world exposure, improved my problem-solving skills, and deepened my understanding of ethical practices in cybersecurity.
